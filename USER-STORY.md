# User Story

## Basic usage of a general conference web app

Given a topic `T`, users can propose talks on the topic `T`.
When the topic has gathered enough related talks,
a group of users can organize a conference in someplace.

Our web app should provide services to help users achieve this, such as
- Finding a place,
- Recording talks,
- Selling tickets, and give money back to talkers,
- Accepting sponsors who post ADs on the conference, and give money back to talkers,
- and so on.

Some of the services might not be used by some users,
for example a group of talkers might wish to do not have ADs,
and wish to do not sell tickets.
